## Moralis API Key

The Dex widget expects a Moralis API key at runtime. Copy `.moralis_api_key.example` to `.moralis_api_key`, replace the placeholder value with your key, and keep the file out of version control. Alternatively, pass the key when building with `--dart-define MORALIS_API_KEY=your-key`.
